    <h1>URL Slugs with Node.js & MongoDB</h1>
    <p>Today I added semantic urls to my blog posts and wanted to take a few minutes to
      document the process and how I set this up here on the <a href="/blog">site</a>. You
      can find the code I used located on my <a href="https://github.com/waterswv/blog-api">GitHub</a>.
      I also found this post by <a href="http://blog.benmcmahen.com/post/41122888102/creating-slugs-for-your-blog-using-expressjs-and">Ben McMahen</a>
      very helpful, and borrowed part of his functions for my implementation. He references some interesting details
      about the history of how <strong>URL Slugs</strong> got their name from the publishing industry which got me to thinking, a bit nostalically,
      back to my days of designing the daily paper layouts working at the <a href="https://www.redandblack.com/">Red & Black</a> when I was in college.</p>

      <p>More on those days in a later non-topical post :). For me, URL slugs were a bit confusing before I had enough experience
      with Mongo lookups and passing 'ids' through routes. </p>
