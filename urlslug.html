    <h1>URL Slugs with Node.js & MongoDB</h1>
      <section>Today I added semantic urls to my blog posts and wanted to take a few minutes to
      document the process and how I set this up here on the <a href="/blog">site</a>. You
      can find the code I used located on my <a href="https://github.com/waterswv/blog-api">GitHub</a>.
      I also found this post by <a href="http://blog.benmcmahen.com/post/41122888102/creating-slugs-for-your-blog-using-expressjs-and">Ben McMahen</a>
      very helpful, and borrowed part of his functions for my implementation. He references some interesting details
      about the history of how <strong>URL Slugs</strong> got their name from the publishing industry which got me to thinking, a bit nostalically,
      back to my days of designing the daily student paper layouts working at the <a href="https://www.redandblack.com/">Red & Black</a> when I was in college.</section>

      <section>More on those days in a later non-topical post :). For me, URL slugs were a bit confusing before I had enough experience
      with Mongo lookups and passing 'attributes' through routes. However, once I got accustomed to using findOne vs findById it turned
      into a fairly simple update. However, like most things, it took several iterations & steps to get the functionality working exactly
      to my specifications. I ended up breaking it out into 3 steps:
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>My steps comprised these updates: </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The Model</li>
        <li>The Route</li>
        <li>The Template Engine</li>
      </ul>
      <p> <h4>The Model</h4>
      The model updates constituted most of the work, but thanks to a nifty reg ex function that I was able to pull from Ben's post
      it didn't take me too long. <br>
      The first step is to setup a function that can be called to format whatever text string we use for our title and then prepend a
      date string to beinginng of it. This will ensure that all my urls are unique to the day they are written.
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/waterswv/dc9edd9f5adb855cd4632601091b1320.js"></script>
      You can see that we first grab the text, and format it with a Regular Expression chain, next we utilize moment.js to
      generate a date and format it in a 2018-02-17 structure.
      <br>
      <br>
      Next we will generate the function that will create the slug during the create call that generates each instance.
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/waterswv/2f332460445ea87feb99f736d954deef.js"></script>
      We accomplish this by utilizing the .pre() function that will take our title field and generate the slug field before
      finishing the create method during our post call from the api.
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally we will update the Schema to include the 'slug: String' as a new storage field.
      <br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/waterswv/bf4e1cbe7569e72c05f1e19ea7f3401b.js"></script>
    </p>
    <p> <h4>The Route</h4>
    The route is a much simpler process, all we need to do is make a small update to the find method and add a k:v pair search parameter.
    Below is before & after.
     <script src="https://gist.github.com/waterswv/0855d42b4a4571a9995b959bc4ff9965.js"></script>
     <br>
    </p>
    <p> <h4>The Template Engine</h4>
      And finally the template engine update is the simplest of all. You swap out the variable name of _id for slug.

      <p>Overall this took me a few hours to implement beacuse the Mongo docs are as I'm sure you've noticed lacking to say the least.
      However, the majority of the work was figuring out the proper format for <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/">moment.js</a> &
      <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/markdown-docs/queries.html">findOne</a>. If you aren't familiar with template
      engines, the <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">HandlebarsJS</a> documentation is pretty good and you can find some helpful examples
      to implement with express on stackoverflow.</p>
      <p>Thanks for visiting and feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:blog@bryanmierke.com">email</a> if you have any questions!</p>
