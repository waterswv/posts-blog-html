       <strong>ForwardJS</strong> is a conference for the passionate community of Javascript; it's a 1 day event that's normally
        held twice a year, once in San Francisco, and another one in Ottawa.

      On Tuesday I had the opportunity to volunteer and spend the entire day at the <a href="https://forwardjs.com/" target='_blank'>ForwardJS</a>
      conference held here in San Francisco. It was a collection of some great people in the world of Javascript. And
      as someone who is used to mainly going to Ad & FinTech conferences it was a refreshing shift to an event where the
      collective group was extremely engaged and welcoming from a networking & non-sales approach type of mindset. Being this
      was my first time attending, I openly admit that my sample size is limited, but overall I thought the content was helpful
      and that the community seems to really support inclusiveness & the growth of new developers, like myself, to sharpening
      their skills and figuring out how to advance both their work & side projects. I'd recommend the conference to anyone
      who is looking to learn better practices, network with people to collaborate on projects, or hear about interesting
      projects that some of the top companies are working on internally. The conference had a little of it all and videos of
      certain talks will be posted soon on the <a href="https://forwardcourses.com/lectures" target='_blank'>Lectures Page</a>! Additionally,
      for those of you that are looking for a deeper dive into a specific discipline, they offer
      <a href="https://forwardcourses.com/" target='_blank'> online courses</a> & 1 day workshops on the front & tail end of the conference days.

      As a bootcamp graduate I find these types of events invaluable due to the nature of how much of the unknown unknowns they
      help me to discover. Just by attending the event I was able to have dozens of conversations with people who are going,
      have gone, or enjoy providing advice on going through the initial ramp-up learning process for becoming an active developer. I
      had a nice conversation with a woman on the pro & cons of server-side rendering and why it's not always the best approach
      depending on the size of your application. While this is something that I had been told in the past, the beginning of
      my development career has been like drinking from 2 fire hoses so it had escaped me until this random chat that occurred
      waiting for the next speaker to start. I was then able to find some helpful articles like
      <a href="https://medium.com/walmartlabs/the-benefits-of-server-side-rendering-over-client-side-rendering-5d07ff2cefe8" target='_blank'>this</a>.
      that helped me to get a better grasp on the core concepts that I'm sure will be valuable in either an interview setting or
      during an upcoming project.

      I'll definitely be keeping my eyes open for more events like <a href="https://forwardjs.com/" target='_blank'>ForwardJS</a> in the future as I continue my journey. Also, for those of
      you like me who don't have an employer sponsoring conferences, I was able to secure a free ticket by offering to volunteer for
      the event by cold-emailing the conference info@ email. They needed help and by showing up a couple hours early and checking
      people in to get their badges I got to attend for free. And the best part was that check-in wrapped up shortly after the
      keynote ended so I got to attend all of the track timeslots for the entire day. <br> <br> Thanks for reading and drop me a line if you have any questions at
      <a href="mailto:blog@bryanmierke.com">blog@bryanmierke.com</a> or find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanMierke" target='_blank'>@BryanMierke</a>.
      I'm always looking for new friends to work on projects or bounce ideas off!
