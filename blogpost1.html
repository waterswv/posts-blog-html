Today is Feb 6th, 2018 and I’m officially launching my personal site.
It took me approximately 4 days to build this site which I started from a creative commons template built by
<a href="https://html5up.net/" target='_blank'>HTML5 Up</a>. From there I modified the design & built a fully restful backend leveraging Node.js & mongoDB. I also leveraged the express-handlebars package manager to generate templates and serve dynamic pages from content stored in my mongo instance. The site is hosted through heroku and I’m currently in the process of setting up analytics and tracking. Over the next week i’ll be writing some follow up posts detailing Node.js setup, Handlebars, and some of the cool design manipulation that this site has utilized. Thanks for taking the time to read, you can check out my previous work on the <a href=‘/portfolio’>portfolio page</a> and feel free to shoot any questions to <a href=‘mailto:blog@bryanmierke.com’>blog@bryanmierke.com</a>.
